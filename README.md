# Audio Splitter

Audio Splitter is a Python application that allows you to split audio files into smaller segments based on duration and remove silent parts. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with PyQt5 and utilizes the PyDub library for audio processing.

## Features

- Add audio files in various formats (MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A)
- Specify the segment duration in seconds
- Adjust the silence threshold to remove silent parts
- Choose the output format for the audio segments
- Monitor progress with a progress bar
- Export the segmented audio files as a zip archive

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyQt5
- PyDub
- FFmpeg (required by PyDub for audio file processing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pyqt5 pydub
   ```
3. Install FFmpeg. Refer to the FFmpeg documentation for installation instructions based on your operating system.
